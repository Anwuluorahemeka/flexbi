Zee is another super market that is biased about its profits ,
so i ran this analysis to enqire 
how sales took place on different loactions  by month and yearly 
also gifted all sales rep with higher sales record as encouragement.
						

average margins per customer = divide( [avg profit per transaction], [average sales per customer], 0)

average sales per customer = AVERAGEX(
                                VALUES(sales[Customers] ),
                                  [total amount])

avg profit per transaction = AVERAGEX(
                                VALUES(sales[Customers] ),
                                  [total profit])   


profit target met? = if([profit%]>0.5, "🏆", "🏅")


profit% = DIVIDE([total profit],[total amount])

total amount = sum(sales[Amountsold])

total cost = sum(sales[actual C0ST])

total profit = [total amount]-[total cost]
