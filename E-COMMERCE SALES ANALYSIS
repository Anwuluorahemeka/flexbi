I have an ecommerce company data that wants to know how much
they have been losing due to dull and slow business return. 
So was able to analyze their data further with Microsoft power bi apply some month over month,
same period last year and was able to get an insight, visualized with power bi and presented detailed solution which helped


%profitmargin = DIVIDE( [Total profit], [Totalsales], 0)

Total costs = 
SUMX(fashion,fashion[Sales] * fashion[Quantity] )


Total profit = SUM(fashion[Profit])

Totalsales = sum(fashion[Sales])
